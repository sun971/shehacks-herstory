# HerStory - SheHacks 2023

## How to run
```python3 main.py```

## Inspiration
Despite significant efforts and improvement towards gender equality, STEM related fields remain male dominated, with women frequently underrepresented and overlooked. Such gender disparity not only discourages women from pursuing these fields, but also young girls' aspirations and attitudes towards STEM careers. The SheHacks event itself was a source of inspiration for us; as SheHacks aims to support and motivate post-secondary female students get involved in the tech space, and we also wanted to find a way to achieve the same effect within a younger audience. Our team hopes to address the gender imbalance and inspire future generations of women by educating them about the pioneering contributions women have made to the field through a fun and interactive game that takes the player along their own journey towards a treasure (enlightenment). 

## What it does
Our current version of the game starts out with the player being introducted to their mission and beinng provided a map. They will then meet 3 characters, and will choose 1 to interact with. Each pioneering women is associated with a specific problem the player has to solve, and as the player progresses through the challenge, they will recieve task related hints from the pioneering woman, as well as bits of information about their story. Once the player successfully completes the task, they will get the opportunity to read an in-depth summary on their helping friend as well as their contributions to the STEM field. Once the player completes all three tasks, they will win the game and reach the treasure. At the end of the game, the player should have learned about 3 amazing women in STEM's stories and ideally feel encouraged and motivated to pursue their own goals. 

## How we built it
HerStory was developed using Python, and for game specific functionalities we utilized pygame. Piskel and avatarsinpixels were used to create our graphical designs. 

## Challenges we ran into
We intially ran into some issues with Github pulling and merging due to lack of clarity about how github works, which set our progress back in some portions of our game. Another problem we ran into were bug issues and glitches that we needed to fix in our graphics, which was made more difficult by the fact none of us were familiar with pygame. Much research, discussion, and debugging was needed to work through these glitches. 

## What we are proud of
With SheHacks being half of our groups first hackathon, we feel proud of the fact we were able to work harmoniously to plan, develop and implement an idea we all passionate and proud of. As well, it was all of our first experiences with game development, so we feel accomplished in what we were able to achieve with limited knowledge. As strangers coming into this experience, 

## What we learned
We learned how to utilize pygame to handle our graphics and interactions, as well as all developed a better understanding of the ins and outs of Github. We also learned the importance of adaptability and time management as we had originally planned for the implementation of much more, and quickly had to adjust once we realized it was not completely doable within the time constraints. 


## What's Next
We hope to further develop our game to highlight more contributions of women to the world, by introducing new challenges that require skills that different women in STEM are known for. We wish to introduce a point collection system within each task as well as more developed win/lose requirements to create a more challenging and engaging game for more experienced gamers.
